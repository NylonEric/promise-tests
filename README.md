# Promise Behavior Testing

> A collection of jest tests to explore and demonstrate the behaviors within promise chains.

### I wasn't satisfied with the explanations and examples of the more complex promise chain behavior in the various documentation I was finding so I made this project to test my intuitions on behaviors like:
* .then() blocks after .catch() blocks
* .finally() blocks
* throw() behavior

#### Information on promises:
